            <h1>Understanding Your Skin: A Guide to Different Skin Types and How to Care for Them</h1>
            <p>Healthy, glowing skin starts with understanding your unique skin type. Knowing your skin type allows you to choose the right products, create an effective skincare routine, and address specific concerns. Whether your skin is oily, dry, combination, sensitive, or normal, each type of care for each one has its own set of characteristics and needs. Let’s explore the different skin types and how to care for them.</p>
        </header>

        <section class="skin-type">
            <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Shiny complexion, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin). Prone to acne, blackheads, and whiteheads.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is my skin oily?</strong> Oily skin is the result of overactive sebaceous glands that produce excess sebum (oil). While sebum helps protect and moisturize the skin, too much of it can lead to clogged pores and breakouts.</p>
            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Oily Skin:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a gentle, foaming cleanser twice a day to remove excess oil without stripping your skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate:</strong> Incorporate a salicylic acid-based exfoliator to help unclog pores and reduce acne.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizers that hydrate without adding extra oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Apply a lightweight, matte-finish sunscreen daily.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="skin-type">
            <h2>Dry Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Tight, rough, or flaky texture. Dull complexion, prone to redness, irritation, and fine lines.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is my skin dry?</strong> Dry skin lacks sufficient moisture due to factors like genetics, environmental conditions (cold weather, low humidity), and the natural aging process. This skin type produces less sebum, leading to a weakened moisture barrier.</p>
            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Dry Skin:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a hydrating, non-foaming cleanser to avoid stripping natural oils.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Apply a deeply emollient moisturizer immediately after cleansing to lock in moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a Humidifier:</strong> Add moisture to the air to prevent your skin from drying out.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrating Ingredients:</strong> Look for products with hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides to boost hydration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="skin-type">
            <h2>Combination Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) and dry or normal on the cheeks and other areas. Prone to breakouts in oily areas and dryness in others.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is my skin combination?</strong> Combination skin is characterized by a mix of oily and dry areas. This skin type can be challenging to manage because it requires a balanced approach to care for both oily and dry regions effectively.</p>
            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Combination Skin:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Opt for a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser that won’t over-dry or over-moisturize your skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Treatments:</strong> Use oil-control products on the T-zone and hydrating products on dry areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate:</strong> Regularly exfoliate to prevent clogged pores in oily areas, but be gentle on drier regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Selectively Moisturize:</strong> Apply a lightweight moisturizer to the entire face or use different moisturizers for different areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="skin-type">
            <h2>Sensitive Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Easily irritated, red, or inflamed. Prone to itching, burning, or stinging sensations. Reacts to certain skincare products, environmental factors, or stress.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is my skin sensitive?</strong> Sensitive skin often results from a weakened skin barrier, making it more susceptible to irritants. This skin type can be triggered by factors like harsh skincare products, allergens, or extreme weather conditions.</p>
            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Sensitive Skin:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose Gentle Products:</strong> Opt for fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products designed for sensitive skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Patch Test:</strong> Always perform a patch test before introducing new products into your routine.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Keep your skin hydrated with soothing moisturizers and barrier-repairing ingredients like ceramides and aloe vera.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Treatments:</strong> Skip abrasive exfoliants and opt for gentle exfoliation methods like enzyme peels.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="skin-type">
            <h2>Normal Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Balanced oil and moisture levels, smooth, even texture, with few or no blemishes or sensitivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is my skin normal?</strong> Normal skin has a balanced production of sebum and good circulation, resulting in an even complexion and a healthy skin barrier. While this skin type is relatively low-maintenance, it still requires proper care to maintain its health.</p>
            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Normal Skin:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleansing:</strong> Maintain a simple routine of cleansing, toning, and moisturizing daily to keep your skin in balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day to protect from sun damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate:</strong> Exfoliate once or twice a week to maintain smooth, glowing skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Choose a lightweight moisturizer that maintains the skin's natural balance.</li>
            </ul>
