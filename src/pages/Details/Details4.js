        <section class="brush-guide">
            <h2>1. Foundation Brush</h2>
            <p>A foundation brush is key to achieving a smooth and even base. Available in various shapes, such as flat and tapered, this brush allows for precise application of liquid or cream foundation. For a natural finish, use a brush with densely packed bristles to blend the product seamlessly into your skin.</p>

            <h2>2. Concealer Brush</h2>
            <p>To tackle blemishes and under-eye circles, a concealer brush is your best friend. These brushes are usually smaller and have a pointed or rounded tip for precise application. The bristles are typically softer, making it easier to blend concealer without disturbing the foundation underneath.</p>

            <h2>3. Powder Brush</h2>
            <p>A fluffy powder brush is ideal for setting your makeup with loose or pressed powder. The large, soft bristles help to distribute the product evenly across your face, ensuring a smooth and matte finish. This brush is also great for applying bronzer or blush.</p>

            <h2>4. Blush Brush</h2>
            <p>Blush brushes come in various shapes, but a classic option is the angled or rounded brush. These brushes help to apply blush precisely to the apples of your cheeks, giving a natural flush of color. Choose a brush with soft bristles to avoid harsh lines and ensure a seamless blend.</p>

            <h2>5. Eyeshadow Brush</h2>
            <p>Eyeshadow brushes are essential for creating a variety of eye looks. There are several types, including flat brushes for applying shadow to the lid, fluffy brushes for blending, and pencil brushes for precise application along the crease or lash line. Investing in a good eyeshadow brush set can help you achieve everything from a subtle everyday look to a dramatic evening style.</p>

            <h2>6. Eyeliner Brush</h2>
            <p>For precise eyeliner application, a fine-tipped eyeliner brush is crucial. Whether you’re using gel, cream, or powder eyeliner, a brush with a thin, angled tip allows for control and accuracy, helping you create everything from a subtle line to a bold wing.</p>

            <h2>7. Brows Brush</h2>
            <p>A brow brush typically comes with a spoolie on one end and an angled brush on the other. The spoolie is used to brush through your brows and remove any excess product, while the angled brush helps to fill in and define your brows with powders or pomades.</p>

            <h2>8. Fan Brush</h2>
            <p>A fan brush is versatile and can be used for applying highlighter, dusting off excess powder, or even for precise contouring. Its unique shape allows for a light and even application of highlighter, creating a subtle, glowing effect.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Brushes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean Regularly:</strong> Wash your brushes at least once a week with a gentle brush cleaner or mild soap. This prevents the buildup of makeup and bacteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Properly:</strong> After washing, reshape the bristles and lay the brushes flat to dry. Avoid drying them upright to prevent water from seeping into the ferrule.</li>
                <li><strong>Store Wisely:</strong> Keep your brushes in a clean, dry place. Using a brush holder or a case helps maintain their shape and prevents them from getting damaged.</li>
            </ul>
