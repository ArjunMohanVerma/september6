            <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
            <p>Start your day by cleansing your face to start a new day for a revitalizing look. Next, use a toner to balance your skin's pH and minimize pores, prepping your skin for the rest of your routine. Apply a vitamin C serum to protect your skin from pollution, aging, and dullness while giving it a healthy glow. Follow up with a lightweight moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and nourished. Finally, finish with sunscreen, using at least SPF 30, to shield your skin from harmful UV rays.</p>

            <h2>Evening Routine</h2>
            <p>After a long day, your skin deserves some pampering to relax and recover. Start with a double cleanse—begin by using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup and sunscreen, followed by a water-based cleanser to clean away any remaining impurities. Next, exfoliate 2-3 times a week with a chemical exfoliant like AHA or BHA to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Reapply toner to keep your skin balanced.</p>
            <p>Once your pores are clean, apply a hydrating or anti-aging serum, such as hyaluronic acid or retinol, depending on your skin’s needs. Gently apply an eye cream to the under-eye area to reduce puffiness, dark circles, or fine lines. Then, use a richer, more nourishing moisturizer to lock in hydration overnight. Finally, seal in moisture with a face oil or apply an overnight mask for extra hydration before you rest.</p>
